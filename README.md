Biolog1c
========

`Biolog1c' is my submission to the 2015 `Battlecode' competition run by MIT.
I've decided to release its source for all to review, modify, and play with.
I only ask that you please not use the source, or portions of the source
as your team's submission to this year's Battlecode competition.
You may reach me by email: alan.z@cox.net.
If I don't know you please put `Cold contact' as your subject line.
